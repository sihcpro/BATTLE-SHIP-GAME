# BATTLE-SHIP-GAME
This is my favorit froject when I was third-year student in my university.
It is a file to compile on Aduno Microchip and we ( me and Bang Nguyen Thanh ( https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100007672665254 ) had writen it. He had helped me in connect the electrical circuit. And after that, I wrote almost the other. Because I belived that we can't do anything fast without only one logic throught from start to the end of it. So sometime, you will do it faster if you do it alone.
I had make a bunch of protocol and I really happy when I see that. Because every single variable, I give it a name and no more fix when you need more protocol.
When it had done, we stil dream about something bigger but time never wait any one. So that, you had more Project and you have no time :D
